Hi I am a Master's student in Computer Science at NYU Courant, with a deep interest in cryptography, complexity theory, and theoretical computer science. I hold an undergraduate degree in Physics from the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee.

During my undergrad, I discovered my interest for algorithms and theory through competitive programming. On the applied side, I am also intrigued by Zero-Knowledge Proofs, where abstract concepts that may seem counterintuitive at first can be applied to solve real-world problems.
